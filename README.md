# Generative AI, Scientific Integrity, and Intellectual Property

This repository contains a **LaTeX report** and a **Beamer presentation** developed for an academic course project at **Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO)**.

The project focuses on the **critical evaluation of a hypothetical generative AI tool** designed to assist academic research. The analysis examines key issues related to:
- Scientific integrity and research ethics  
- Intellectual property and data governance  
- Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)  
- Valorization and dissemination of AI-based research tools  

The work was completed as a **team project** and follows academic writing and presentation standards using **LaTeX, BibTeX, and Beamer**.
